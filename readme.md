Don't have an hour or even twenty minutes to exercise each day? You might not need it.
This routine of 12 exercises is a complete workout based on the latest fitness researchâ€”and it only takes 7 minutes.
The routine was posted in the May-June issue of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal and highlighted by *** [TAKEDOWN - a famous journal from NY](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-7min/blob/master/takedown/20130506-nytimes.jpg) ***.


## Getting Started

Clone the repo.
>
``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/travisrussi/angular-7min-triggerio.git
```

Install the pre-requisite packages using `npm`.
>
``` bash
$ sudo npm install bower grunt-cli --global
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

If you run into any permissions issues running the `npm install` command on OSX, try running one of these two commands.
>
``` bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local
$ sudo chown -R $USER /Users/[yourusername]/.npm
```

Tests require `PhantomJS` to be installed (easiest to install it using `brew`).
>
``` bash
$ brew update
$ brew install phantomjs
```

Quick start using `grunt` that fires up a local webserver at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) which points to the **src** folder.
>
``` bash
$ grunt server
```

You can build the latest version using `grunt`.
>
``` bash
$ grunt build
```

Run the javascript unit tests with `karma` (requires `PhantomJS`).
>
``` bash
$ grunt test
```
